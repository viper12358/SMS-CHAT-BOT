Using Twilio(Communication API) we have created a SMS chat box,and a voice Communication system.

NUMBER: 1(510) 822-6787
        1(510) 8-CAMPUS

For the SMS chat box, it simply works by inputting specific commands. What our program does is that
it looks at keywords, in a sentence(text-message) and replies accordingly. An example is:

"Hello, i am new to this University."

If this command is sent as a message to the number while the bot is running, the bot will reply
with an introduction. 

Using the word "Commands". One can see what commands can be used for the bot.

You can also see via text messages, memes, facts, quotes,... off reddit. By simplying texting Meme, fact, interesting, quote, deep, Learn, Comic
 /r/bonehurtingjuice and /r/Memes -> All memes come from these sub reddits
 /r/TodayIlerned -> Fact, interesting, Learn
/r/Iam14andthisisdeep -> quote, deep
/r/Polandball -> Comic
For the Voice(calling the number), there are 4 options avaliable. One can press the first 2 to be forwarded to 
the campus service phone line. 
One can press 3 to get a random fact(/r/TodayILearned)
or can press 4 to get a random joke off reddit using a Reddit API (Pleasee Don't be offended by the joke as the joke is chosen randomly
off /r/jokes)


In order to run the program, Get all the files and put them together in a single directory. Once this is done, all that needs to be done
is that the bot.py file needs to be run using python.

python bot.py

Once ran the bot will be running. One can see this using tmux a. Then simply take out your phone, and do as you will!! Have FUN!!!
